                <p>
                    Health care refers to an organized provision of medical services to maintain and improve human health. However, in the United States, U.S. healthcare is more of a business, and patients are paying customers. Health insurance plays a crucial role in determining who gets access to which type of care and the costs involved. 
                    One concern is rising costs as in 2025, the average monthly premium for the silver plan under the Affordable Care Act was approximately $621, a 7% increase from 2024. Despite being a mid-tier plan, it is very expensive and can be financially burdensome for many, even with deductibles, copayments, and out-of-pocket costs.
                    Another concern is many Americans having their insurance claims denied. In 2023, insurers of marketplace plans denied about 20% of all in-network claims and an even higher percentage of out-of-network care. Shockingly, fewer than 1% of denials were ever appealed, often due to the lack of awareness or how complex the appeals process is. 
                    Overall, there are disparities when it comes to access, claim approvals, and cost-effectiveness that create concerns about the efficiency of the existing insurance model. Hence, we have created an effective data-driven solution by identifying trends and helping to analyze these issues with factors such as income levels, unemployment status, and geographic location.
