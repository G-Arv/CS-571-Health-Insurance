"Notes"
"The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to the data collection because of the coronavirus pandemic. "

"Data may not sum to totals due to rounding."
""
"Data include the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the United States."
