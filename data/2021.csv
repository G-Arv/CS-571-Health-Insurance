"Notes"
"The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to the data collection because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type."
""
"Data may not sum to totals due to rounding."
""
"Data include the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the United States."
